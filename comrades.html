              <p>
                The Vrije Bond (Free Union) is a group of people who are trying
                to build a different society: a society without hierarchies,
                without oppression and without exploitation of humans, animals
                and the environment. An anarchist society in which we deal with
                each other on a basis of equality. The members of the Vrije Bond
                are all working in their own way, in their own city,
                neighborhood, job or action group, to create such a society.
                They are doing this through direct action, by organizing
                discussions, writing articles or supplying information. The
                Vrije Bond serves as a platform to meet each other, to exchange
                experiences, to develop theory and strategies, but also to
                organize activities and to support them.

              <p>
                We are anarchists and we believe in intersectionality. We are
                against all forms of exploitation and oppression including but
                not limited to those based on class, race, sex, sexuality,
                gender or ability. Our feminism is trans and sex-worker
                inclusive. We believe that we can not effectively challenge the
                patriarchy if we do not also fight to abolish capitalism and the
                state. At the same time, we are tired of waiting for our own
                liberation, too often other forms of oppression are seen as an
                afterthought or as coming secondary to the class struggle. Our
                spaces, although they are anarchist, are not exempted from
                structural forms of violence and oppression. As long as we do
                not have effective structures in places to challenges these
                forms of violence they will not go away by themselves.

              <p>
                Stop the War on Migrants is a self-organised collective which
                focuses on the militarization of the EU borders and current
                policies regarding migration. Campaigns are mainly targeted at
                institutions, like Frontex, arms and security companies, and
                other players involved when it comes to border militarization
                and deportations.

            <p>
              Sprout Distro is an anarchist zine distro (distributor) and
              publisher based in the occupied territory currently known as the
              United States. We distribute zines as a way of contributing to the
              increased proliferation of anarchist projects and resistance. We
              primarily distribute zines via this website and in person at zine
              fests, book fairs, and other such events. We make all the zines we
              carry available as PDFs for folks to download, print, and
              distribute themselves. Our distro mainly focuses on anarchist
              tactics and skill-building. This means that we have a lot of zines
              on direct action, organizing, starting projects (ex: collectives,
              study groups, prisoner support projects), decision-making, street
              tactics, security, affinity groups, how we relate to each other,
              etc.

            <p>
              Crimethink is everything that evades control: the daydream in the
              classroom, the renegade breaking ranks, the spray-painted walls
              that continue to speak even under martial law. It is the
              persistent sense that things could be otherwise, that there is
              nothing natural or inevitable about the prevailing social order.
              In a world optimized for administration, everything that cannot be
              classified or displayed on a screen is crimethink. It is the
              spirit of rebellion without which freedom is literally
              unthinkable.
